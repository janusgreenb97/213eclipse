//TODO:
-Please change Year field in Song model to String. No need to be Int type!
-Sorted display(observable list): alphabetical order of names, (same name, alphabetical order to artists) (comparable, binary search?)
(***)case insensitive: means Strawberry Field = strawberry field
-edit:
 -if name or artist is null, cannot save, error pop up
 -if name and artist becomes similar to another song in the lib, error pop up
 -However, if name or artist are as same as the song that is being editing, only change other propertities.
 -if the edit is valid, ask for confirm, if confirmed, change property of song object.
-add finish (check method?).
